    "overall_reasoning": "Viem represents a paradigm shift in Ethereum TypeScript tooling through revolutionary API design and architectural innovations. Its type-safe, modular approach with client separation and tree-shaking capabilities set new industry standards for developer experience. While building upon Ethereum fundamentals, it introduced original patterns like composable actions and transport abstraction that influenced the ecosystem. The main innovations lie in developer ergonomics rather than protocol-level breakthroughs. It significantly advanced state-of-the-art for Ethereum interfaces but didn't create new cryptographic primitives or foundational standards.",
