    "overall_reasoning": "Ethers.js represents significant innovation in JavaScript Ethereum tooling, particularly in developer experience where its API patterns became industry standards. When launched in 2016, it pioneered modular architecture and modern async patterns that addressed web3.js limitations. While not algorithmically groundbreaking, it transformed JS development through exceptional API design and implementation quality. Its influence is evident in competitors adopting its patterns, though core protocol work remains evolutionary rather than revolutionary.",
