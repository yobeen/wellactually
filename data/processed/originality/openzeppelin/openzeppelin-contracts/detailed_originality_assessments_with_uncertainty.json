    "overall_reasoning": "OpenZeppelin Contracts represents foundational innovation in smart contract security and standardization. Its breakthrough contribution lies in establishing reusable, audited security patterns that became the Ethereum ecosystem's default building blocks. While not inventing core cryptographic primitives, it created novel security architectures (upgradeability system) and developer paradigms that defined industry standards. The library's profound ecosystem impact stems from making secure contract development accessible, directly influencing ERC evolution and setting security expectations. Its originality manifests in comprehensive implementation rigor rather than theoretical novelty, with scores weighted toward its standards leadership (10/10) and security pattern definition (9/10).",
