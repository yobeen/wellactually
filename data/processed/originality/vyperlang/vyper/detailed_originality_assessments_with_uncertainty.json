        "reasoning": "Revolutionary security-first design: intentional feature limitations (no recursion, modifiers), built-in overflow protection, and decidable reverts.

    "overall_reasoning": "Vyper represents a paradigm shift in smart contract security through radical simplicity constraints, making it one of Ethereum's most original technical contributions. Its security innovations (intentional feature limitations, formal verification focus) became industry benchmarks that reshaped language design philosophy. While less revolutionary in performance or tooling, its security-first approach created lasting ecosystem impact by proving that reduced expressiveness enhances verifiability. The Pythonic syntax lowered onboarding barriers but didn't achieve Solidity-level ecosystem dominance. Groundbreaking in security philosophy yet pragmatic in implementation.",
