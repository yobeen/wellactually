        "score": 1,
        "weight": 0.2,
        "reasoning": "The EIPs repository does not implement any protocol features itself. It serves as a specification hub where protocol changes are proposed and documented, but implementation occurs in client repositories. Therefore, it scores minimally on implementation depth.",

      "algorithmic_innovation": {
        "score": 3,
        "weight": 0.1,
        "reasoning": "The repository documents algorithmic innovations within EIPs (e.g., EIP-1559's fee market redesign), but doesn't implement them. Scoring reflects its role as an innovation catalog rather than an implementation source.",

      },
      "developer_experience": {
        "score": 6,
        "weight": 0.15,
        "reasoning": "While primarily a specification repository, it innovates through standardized templates and automated validation workflows. The EIP bot automates metadata checks, and the website generation creates navigable standards documentation. However, developer tooling is secondary to its core standards function.",

      "architectural_innovation": {
        "score": 7,
        "weight": 0.1,
        "reasoning": "The repository architecture follows conventional RFC-style organization. Its innovation lies in the process architecture - the EIP workflow with categories (Core/ERC/Networking) and status tracking - which became the model for blockchain governance systems.",

      "security_innovation": {
        "score": 4,
        "weight": 0.05,
        "reasoning": "Security contributions are indirect through standards like ERC-20's overflow checks (EIP-20) or formal verification requirements in EIPs. The repository itself doesn't implement security mechanisms but enables security-focused standards.",

      "standards_leadership": {
        "score": 10,
        "weight": 0.2,
        "reasoning": "This is the foundational repository for Ethereum standards creation. It houses ERC-20, ERC-721, and other transformative standards that defined entire industry categories. The EIP process pioneered decentralized technical governance in blockchain, making it the origin point for most Ethereum protocol innovations.",

      "cross_client_compatibility": {
        "score": 10,
        "weight": 0.2,
        "reasoning": "As the canonical source for protocol specifications, EIPs enable cross-client compatibility by providing unambiguous standards. The repository's rigorous status tracking (Draft/Review/Final) and explicit compatibility requirements in network upgrades (e.g., London, Shanghai) are critical infrastructure for ecosystem-wide interoperability.",

    "overall_reasoning": "The EIPs repository is the origin point of Ethereum's most transformative innovations, serving as the canonical standards engine. While not an implementation itself, it pioneered decentralized technical governance and produced industry-defining standards (ERC-20/721). Its innovation lies in creating the collaborative framework that enabled Ethereum's evolution. The repository's historical impact is monumental - nearly all Ethereum protocol changes originate here - but scores lower in implementation-focused criteria since it delegates execution to clients. The weighted score reflects its unparalleled standards leadership balanced against its non-implementation role.",
