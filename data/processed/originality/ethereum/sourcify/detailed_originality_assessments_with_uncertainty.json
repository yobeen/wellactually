    "overall_reasoning": "Sourcify demonstrates significant innovation in developer experience by decentralizing smart contract verification \u2013 a paradigm shift from centralized services like Etherscan. Its core originality lies in: 1) IPFS/Swarm-based metadata storage creating verifiable authenticity, 2) Chain-agnostic verification workflow, and 3) Standardization of decentralized verification processes. While not algorithmically groundbreaking, it solved critical trust problems in contract verification at a time when centralized services dominated. The ecosystem impact is substantial, with its approach becoming the de facto standard adopted by major explorers and tooling. However, it builds upon existing compilers and EVM standards rather than creating fundamental new protocols.",
