It implements core protocol features like state transitions, gas calculation, and opcode execution with original Python-specific optimizations (e.g., JIT-friendly design). However, it follows the Ethereum specification without fundamentally altering the EVM model.",

        "weight": 0.1,
        "reasoning": "Introduced Python-specific optimizations like pre-compiled contract optimizations and specialized data structures for state management. Its JIT-friendly architecture enables experimental performance enhancements, but these remain Python-bound and haven't significantly influenced other client implementations.",

Its API influenced tools like eth-tester and Brownie, becoming the standard for Python-based Ethereum development.

    "overall_reasoning": "Py-EVM demonstrates substantial technical originality as a complete Python EVM implementation, particularly in modular design and testing utilities. Its greatest innovation lies in cross-client interoperability, where it enables critical ecosystem infrastructure. However, as a specification-following implementation, it extends rather than redefines core protocols. The Python-native optimizations and developer tooling are significant within their domain but haven't reshaped broader Ethereum standards. Historical context is crucial: when launched (2017), it provided a unique research-friendly alternative to production clients, accelerating protocol experimentation.",
