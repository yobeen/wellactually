        "reasoning": "Grandine implements the Ethereum consensus protocol from scratch in Rust, including beacon state management, block processing, and attestation handling. It's not a fork of Lighthouse (though same team) but shares no code. However, it strictly follows the Ethereum spec without introducing novel protocol-level changes. The implementation is robust but doesn't redefine protocol standards.",

        "reasoning": "Grandine's core innovation is resource efficiency for embedded systems/Raspberry Pi. It introduces novel attestation aggregation strategies and state transition optimizations using Rust's async/await with Tokio. The BLS signature handling uses blst library optimizations. While impactful for edge devices, these aren't yet ecosystem-adopted breakthroughs.",

        "weight": 0.12,
        "reasoning": "Features a modular design separating networking, state transition, and validator duties. The architecture prioritizes minimal resource footprint with custom allocators and stripped-down dependencies. While clean, it doesn't introduce groundbreaking patterns beyond its efficiency focus.",

        "reasoning": "Implements standard fuzzing (libFuzzer) and SSZ tree hashing optimizations. Uses formal methods for critical components via Kani but doesn't pioneer new verification approaches. Security practices mirror Sigma Prime's Lighthouse work without major innovations.",

    "overall_reasoning": "Grandine demonstrates significant technical merit as a from-scratch Rust implementation optimized for resource-constrained environments. Its primary innovation lies in algorithmic efficiency for edge devices, particularly in attestation handling and state transition. However, it doesn't introduce groundbreaking protocol changes or ecosystem-shifting concepts. The work extends client diversity meaningfully but operates within established paradigms rather than redefining them. Its value is in proving lightweight consensus viability, not in pioneering novel approaches adopted network-wide.",
